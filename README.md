# timestamper
Create a timestamped video from a still image, and an audio file.

## How to run it

```
./timestamps.sh <seed-time>
```

`<seed-time>` should be in the format `yyyy-mm-dd\ hh:mm` (e.g. `2012-12-01\ 06:35`).

You also need to have an image in this folder called `image.jpg` and an audio file called `audio.mp3`.
