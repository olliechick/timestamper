# timestamper
Create a timestamped video from a still image, and an audio file.

## How to run it

```
./timestamps.sh <seed-time> <audio-filename> <image-filename>
```

`<seed-time>` should be in the format `yyyy-mm-dd\ hh:mm` (e.g. `2012-12-01\ 06:35`).

The rest of the paramters are optional.

By default, `<audio-filename` is set to `audio.mp3`, and `<image-filename>` is set to `image.jpg`.
